We created Sails in 2012 to assist us on Node.js projects, and to make it easier to build full-stack JavaScript applications. We hope it makes your life a little bit easier!


## Version info

This app was originally generated on Sun Mar 25 2018 14:03:40 GMT-0500 (CDT) using Sails v1.0.0-47.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.15.7`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.15.7/lib/core-generators/new). -->


<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
